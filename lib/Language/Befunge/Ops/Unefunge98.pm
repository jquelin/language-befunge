=head1 NAME

Language::Befunge::Ops::Befunge98 - operations supported by a Unefunge-98 interpreter


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines the operations supported by a Unefunge-98 interpreter.
It's used internally when setting up a L::B::Interpreter.

The only subroutine defined is:

=over 4

=item get_ops_map()

return a mapping of the supported letter instructions with the associated
operations.
