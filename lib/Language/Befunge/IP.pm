=head1 NAME

Language::Befunge::IP - an Instruction Pointer for a Befunge-98 program.



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the class implementing the Instruction Pointers. An
Instruction Pointer (aka IP) has a stack, and a stack of stacks that
can be manipulated via the methods of the class.

We need a class, since this is a concurrent Befunge, so we can have
more than one IP travelling on the Lahey space.



=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 my $ip = LB::IP->new( [$dimensions] )

Create a new Instruction Pointer, which operates in a universe of the given
C<$dimensions>. If C<$dimensions> is not specified, it defaults to 2
(befunge world).


=head2 my $clone = $ip->clone()

Clone the current Instruction Pointer with all its stacks, position,
delta, etc. Change its unique ID.



=head1 ACCESSORS

=head2 Attributes

The following is a list of attributes of a Language::Befunge::IP
object. For each of them, a method C<get_foobar> and C<set_foobar>
exists.


=over 4

=item $ip->get_id() / $ip->set_id($id)

The unique ID of the IP (an integer). Don't set the ID yourself.


=item $ip->get_dims()

The number of dimensions this IP operates in (an integer). This is
read-only.


=item $ip->get_position() / $ip->set_position($vec)

The current coordinates of the IP (a C<Language::Befunge::Vector>
object).


=item $ip->get_delta() / $ip->set_delta($vec)

The velocity of the IP (a C<Language::Befunge::Vector> object).


=item $ip->get_storage() / $ip->set_storage($vec)

The coordinates of the storage offset of the IP (a
C<Language::Befunge::Vector> object).


=item $ip->get_data() / $ip->set_data({})

The library private storage space (a hash reference). Don't set this
yourself.
FIXME: not supposed to be accessible


=item $ip->get_string_mode() / set_string_mode($bool)

The string_mode of the IP (a boolean).


=item $ip->get_end() / $ip->set_end($bool)

Whether the IP should be terminated (a boolean).


=item $ip->get_libs() / $ip->set_libs($aref)

The current stack of loaded libraries (an array reference). Don't set
this yourself.
FIXME: not supposed to be accessible


=item $ip->get_ss() / $ip->set_ss($aref)

The stack of stack of the IP (an array reference). Don't set this
yourself.
FIXME: not supposed to be accessible


=item $ip->get_toss() / $ip->set_toss($aref)

The current stack (er, TOSS) of the IP (an array reference). Don't set
this yourself.
FIXME: not supposed to be accessible


=back


=head2 $ip->soss([$])

Get or set the SOSS.



=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 Internal stack

In this section, I speak about the stack. In fact, this is the TOSS - that
is, the Top Of the Stack Stack.

In Befunge-98, standard stack operations occur transparently on the
TOSS (as if there were only one stack, as in Befunge-93).


=over 4

=item scount(  )

Return the number of elements in the stack.


=item spush( value )

Push a value on top of the stack.


=item spush_vec( vector )

Push a vector on top of the stack. The x coordinate is pushed first.


=item spush_args ( arg, ... )

Push a list of argument on top of the stack (the first argument will
be the deeper one). Convert each argument: a number is pushed as is,
whereas a string is pushed as a 0gnirts.

B</!\> Do B<not> push references or weird arguments: this method
supports only numbers (positive and negative) and strings.


=item spop(  )

Pop a value from the stack. If the stack is empty, no error occurs and
the method acts as if it popped a 0.


=item spop_mult( <count> )

Pop multiple values from the stack. If the stack becomes empty, the
remainder of the returned values will be 0.


=item spop_vec(  )

Pop a vector from the stack. Returns a Vector object.


=item spop_gnirts(  )

Pop a 0gnirts string from the stack.


=item sclear(  )

Clear the stack.


=item svalue( offset )

Return the C<offset>th value of the TOSS, counting from top of the
TOSS. The offset is interpreted as a negative value, that is, a call
with an offset of C<2> or C<-2> would return the second value on top
of the TOSS.


=back


=head2 Stack stack

This section discusses about the stack stack. We can speak here about
TOSS (Top Of Stack Stack) and SOSS (second on stack stack).

=over 4

=item ss_count(  )

Return the number of stacks in the stack stack. This of course does
not include the TOSS itself.



=item ss_create( count )

Push the TOSS on the stack stack and create a new stack, aimed to be
the new TOSS. Once created, transfer C<count> elements from the SOSS
(the former TOSS) to the TOSS. Transfer here means move - and B<not>
copy -, furthermore, order is preserved.

If count is negative, then C<count> zeroes are pushed on the new TOSS.


=item ss_remove( count )

Move C<count> elements from TOSS to SOSS, discard TOSS and make the
SOSS become the new TOSS. Order of elems is preserved.


=item ss_transfer( count )

Transfer C<count> elements from SOSS to TOSS, or from TOSS to SOSS if
C<count> is negative; the transfer is done via pop/push.

The order is not preserved, it is B<reversed>.


=item ss_sizes(  )

Return a list with all the sizes of the stacks in the stack stack
(including the TOSS), from the TOSS to the BOSS.


=item soss_count(  )

Return the number of elements in SOSS.


=item soss_push( value )

Push a value on top of the SOSS.


=item soss_pop_mult( <count> )

Pop multiple values from the SOSS. If the stack becomes empty, the
remainder of the returned values will be 0.


=item soss_push_vec( vector )

Push a vector on top of the SOSS.



=item soss_pop(  )

Pop a value from the SOSS. If the stack is empty, no error occurs and
the method acts as if it popped a 0.


=item soss_pop_vec(  )

Pop a vector from the SOSS. If the stack is empty, no error occurs
and the method acts as if it popped a 0.  returns a Vector.


=item soss_clear(  )

Clear the SOSS.


=back


=head2 Changing direction

=over 4

=item dir_go_east(  )

Implements the C<E<gt>> instruction. Force the IP to travel east.


=item dir_go_west(  )

Implements the C<E<lt>> instruction. Force the IP to travel west.


=item dir_go_north(  )

Implements the C<^> instruction. Force the IP to travel north.

Not valid for Unefunge.


=item dir_go_south(  )

Implements the C<v> instruction. Force the IP to travel south.

Not valid for Unefunge.


=item dir_go_high(  )

Implements the C<h> instruction. Force the IP to travel up.

Not valid for Unefunge or Befunge.


=item dir_go_low(  )

Implements the C<l> instruction. Force the IP to travel down.

Not valid for Unefunge or Befunge.


=item dir_go_away(  )

Implements the C<?> instruction. Cause the IP to travel in a random
cardinal direction (in Befunge's case, one of: north, south, east or
west).


=item dir_turn_left(  )

Implements the C<[> instruction. Rotate by 90 degrees on the left the
delta of the IP which encounters this instruction.

Not valid for Unefunge.  For Trefunge and greater, only affects the
X and Y axes.


=item dir_turn_right(  )

Implements the C<]> instruction. Rotate by 90 degrees on the right the
delta of the IP which encounters this instruction.

Not valid for Unefunge.  For Trefunge and higher dimensions, only
affects the X and Y axes.



=item dir_reverse(  )

Implements the C<r> instruction. Reverse the direction of the IP, that
is, multiply the IP's delta by -1.



=back

=head2 Libraries semantics

=over 4

=item load( obj )

Load the given library semantics. The parameter is an extension object
(a library instance).



=item unload( lib )

Unload the given library semantics. The parameter is the library name.

Return the library name if it was correctly unloaded, undef otherwise.

B</!\> If the library has been loaded twice, this method will only
unload the most recent library. Ie, if an IP has loaded the libraries
( C<FOO>, C<BAR>, C<FOO>, C<BAZ> ) and one calls C<unload( "FOO" )>,
then the IP will follow the semantics of C<BAZ>, then C<BAR>, then
<FOO> (!).


=item extdata( library, [value] )

Store or fetch a value in a private space. This private space is
reserved for libraries that need to store internal values.

Since in Perl references are plain scalars, one can store a reference
to an array or even a hash.
