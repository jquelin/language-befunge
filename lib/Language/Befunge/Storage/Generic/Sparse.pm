=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # create a 3-dimensional LaheySpace.
    my $torus = Language::Befunge::Storage::Generic::Sparse->new(3);
    $torus->clear();
    $torus->store(<<"EOF");

Note you usually don't need to use this module directly.
B<Language::Befunge::Interpreter> can optionally use it.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements an N-dimensional storage space, as a sparse hash.  The
values in the hash are keyed by coordinate strings, as created by stringifying
a Vector object.


=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new( dimensions )

Creates a new Lahey Space.


=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 clear(  )

Clear the torus.


=head2 get_value( vector )

Return the number stored in the torus at the specified location. If
the value hasn't yet been set, it defaults to the ordinal value of a
space (ie, #32).

B</!\> As in Funge, code and data share the same playfield, the
number returned can be either an instruction B<or> a data (or even
both... Eh, that's Funge! :o) ).


=head2 set_value( vector, value )

Write the supplied value in the torus at the specified location.

B</!\> As in Funge, code and data share the same playfield, the
number stored can be either an instruction B<or> a data (or even
both... Eh, that's Funge! :o) ).


=head1 EXTERNAL METHODS

Several methods are inherited from the Language::Befunge::Storage base
class.  These methods are:

    store
    store_binary
    get_char
    get_dims
    rectangle
    expand
    min
    max
    labels_lookup
    _labels_try

Please see the documentation of that module for more information.


=head1 BUGS

None known.  Please inform me if you find one.
