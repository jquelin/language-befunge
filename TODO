not time plan associated - not even an order implied.


* infrastructure:
=================

- move Language::Befunge::libs::* to Language::Befunge::Libs::* (or
whatever) (medium)


* distribution:
===============

- sign module using Module::Signature (minor)


* befunge:
==========

- write a real befunge debugger (medium or major)

- profile some runs of typical befunge programs to spot the
bottlenecks.  fix them. (medium or major)

- implement resource limits (laheyspace sandboxing, instruction
restriction)


* laheyspace:
=============

- write subclasses of Language::Befunge::LaheySpace, for different
  needs:
    . speed (major)
    . multidim (major)
    . etc


* tests:
========

- maybe walk through tests and clean them. (medium)

- perform test coverage and fill in the blanks. using Module::Builder
would help on this one. (medium)
