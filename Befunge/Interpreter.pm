=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new( [filename, ] [ Key => Value, ... ] )

Create a new Befunge interpreter.  As an optional first argument, you
can pass it a filename to read Funge code from (default: blank
torus).  All other arguments are key=>value pairs.  The following
keys are accepted, with their default values shown:

	Dimensions => 2,
	Syntax     => 'befunge98',
	Storage    => 'laheyspace'

=head1 ACCESSORS

The following is a list of attributes of a Language::Befunge
object. For each of them, a method C<get_foobar> and C<set_foobar>
exists, which does what you can imagine - and if you can't, then i
wonder why you are reading this! :-)

=over 4

=item dimensions:

the number of dimensions this interpreter works in.

=item file:

the script filename (a string)

=item params:

the parameters of the script (an array reference)

=item retval:

the current return value of the interpreter (an integer)

=item DEBUG:

wether the interpreter should output debug messages (a boolean)

=item curip:

the current Instruction Pointer processed (a L::B::IP object)

=item ips:

the current set of IPs travelling in the Lahey space (an array
reference)

=item newips:

the set of IPs that B<will> travel in the Lahey space B<after> the
current tick (an array reference)

=item torus:

the current Lahey space (a L::B::LaheySpace object)

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 Utilities

=over 4

=item move_curip( [regex] )

Move the current IP according to its delta on the LaheySpace topology.

If a regex ( a C<qr//> object ) is specified, then IP will move as
long as the pointed character match the supplied regex.

Example: given the code C<;foobar;> (assuming the IP points on the
first C<;>) and the regex C<qr/[^;]/>, the IP will move in order to
point on the C<r>.

=cut

    } else {
        # Moving one step beyond...
        $torus->move_ip_forward($curip);

=item abort( reason )

Abort the interpreter with the given reason, as well as the current
file and coordinate of the offending instruction.

=cut

    my $file = $self->get_file;
    my $v = $self->get_curip->get_position;

Issue a warning if the interpreter has DEBUG enabled.

    $self->get_DEBUG or return;
    warn @_;
}

=head2 Code and Data Storage

=over 4

Read a file (given as argument) and store its code.

Side effect: clear the previous code.

    # Store code.
    $self->set_file( $file );
    $self->store_code( $code );

=item store_code( code )

Store the given code in the Lahey space.

Side effect: clear the previous code.

=head2 Run methods

Run the current code. That is, create a new Instruction Pointer and
move it around the code.

Return the exit code of the program.

=head1 TODO

Write standard libraries.

=back


=head1 BUGS

Although this module comes with a full set of tests, maybe there are
subtle bugs - or maybe even I misinterpreted the Funge-98
specs. Please report them to me.

There are some bugs anyway, but they come from the specs:

=over 4

=item o

About the 18th cell pushed by the C<y> instruction: Funge specs just
tell to push onto the stack the size of the stacks, but nothing is
said about how user will retrieve the number of stacks.

=item o

About the load semantics. Once a library is loaded, the interpreter is
to put onto the TOSS the fingerprint of the just-loaded library. But
nothing is said if the fingerprint is bigger than the maximum cell
width (here, 4 bytes). This means that libraries can't have a name
bigger than C<0x80000000>, ie, more than four letters with the first
one smaller than C<P> (C<chr(80)>).

Since perl is not so rigid, one can build libraries with more than
four letters, but perl will issue a warning about non-portability of
numbers greater than C<0xffffffff>.
